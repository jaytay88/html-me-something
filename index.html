        <h1>Education</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>SIUE</h2>
            <p>In 2006, after graduating high school, I enrolled at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville. I began there as a pre-pharmacy major, but quickly realized that path was not right for me. I changed majors after freshman year to Biological &amp; Medical Sciences, which I continued to study for the duration of my time there.</p>

          <h2>STLCC</h2>
          <p>After taking a hiatus from school to try to figure out my true passion, I enrolled at St. Louis Community College to study Graphic Design. It was during my studies here that I took my first web publishing course as an elective and fell in love with coding.</p>

          <h2>Launchcode</h2>
          <p>After discovering my love for coding, I began trying to teach myself with various online programs. However, I needed a more structured syllabus for learning and after some searching stumbled upon Launchcode.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Walgreens</h3>
            <p>I began my first full-time position as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens while I was still in high school, planning on going to pharmacy school. I continued to work there throughout and after college, spending a total of 8 years as a pharmacy technician.</p>

            <h3>Dierbergs</h3>
            <p>After leaving Walgreens, I began working as a senior pharmacy technician at Dierbergs Pharmacy. I worked between multiple locations for two years until leaving for a position with benefits at a compounding pharmacy.</p>

            <h3>Bellevue</h3>
            <p>I began working as a data entry technician at Bellevue Coumpounding Pharmacy in 2013. After reaching my full potential (and breaking a company record for scripts entered), I was moved to case management, where I dealt one-on-one with the patients using our products. After almost 3 years of work there, a European company bought the pharmacy out and liquidated all assets, essentially laying off all employees. It was then that I decided it was time for a change in career and began looking outside the pharmaceutical field.</p>

            <h3>Brown &amp; Crouppen</h3>
            <p>Due to my experience in case management and data entry, I was able to get a job at a local law firm, Brown &amp; Crouppen, P.C. I took a position in their business development department, managing a network of co-counsel attorneys both in and out of state on all open cases within the network. I was here for 2 years before moving on to another position with a start-up firm.</p>

            <h3>The Bruning Law Firm</h3>
            <p>In November of 2017, I accepted a position at The Bruning Law Firm, a smaller start-up firm in the area, as their Business Development and Marketing Manager. It was here that I was able gain experience in digital marketing and working on the back-end of software programs (without coding knowledge).</p>

        <p>Moving forward, I hope to take the skills I learn in Launchcode, paired with my Graphic Design degree, to jumpstart a career in front-end development, and my end goal is to become a full-stack developer.</p>
